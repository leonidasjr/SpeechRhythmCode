# SpeechRhythmCode
SpeechRhythmExtractor aims to build rhythmic multidimensional modellings taking vowel, consonant, 
phonetic syllable, pause and higher units. Acoustic features are computed from a variety of (the classical) metrics 
and prosodic-acoustic parameters.
This script can be used in a cross-section of diifferent languages and dialects. 
Audio/TEXTGRID files are required and have to be in the same directory of the script.
Please, read the "UserManual" file to check metadata info, segmentation protocol and extracted parameters
